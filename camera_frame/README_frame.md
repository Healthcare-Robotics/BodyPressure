See aluminum framing bill of materials in:

`BodyPressure/camera_frame/bill_of_materials_cameraframe.pdf`. You also need to get eight M5 flathead screws that are 1cm long, and some 1/8" aluminum plates. Overall, these instructions are quite high level and this is more challenging than building anything from IKEA. I suggest you look very carefully through all the instructions and diagrams before you start. Don't hesitate to ask questions by posting an issue on the repo.

## Hardware design for mounting the camera frame to the bedframe
First let's inspect how the camera frame is attached to the bed. It is mounted to the back of the headboard.

The camera frame is mounted to the bedframe at four locations as shown below:

</p>  
It is essential to fix these points securely to ensure safety of the frame. The top two mounts consist of through-holes that you will have to drill through the bed. The bottom two mounts are more tricky, and use 1/8'' thick aluminum plates to hook onto the steel buttons on the bed

## Construction of the base of the frame on the headboard of the bed

Building the bottom brace of the frame. The right side depicts the right bracket (right when facing the headboard from behind the bed).

You will need to use machine shop tools to fabricate the 1/8'' thick aluminum plates. I was able to get away with using a drill press, a band saw, and a table mounted belt sander. The specification diagram for the left bracket is shown below (left when facing the headboard from behind the bed). The right bracket mirrors the left one.
                                                                                                                     <p align="center">

Here are my recommendations for machining each bracket:
1. Cut out a rectangular piece of aluminum as large as the overall dimensions.
2. Use a 15.4 mm diameter drillbit to bore the two holes that will later hook around the steel buttons.
3. Use a mill or a bandsaw to cut the planar slots. 
4. Use a file or a belt sander to file down the 90 degree corners on the slots. This will help the plate to fit around the steel buttons easier.
5. Take a rubber mallet and hammer the plate around the steel buttons. If it fits snugly or you need to hammer it down a bit, that is good. It should not fit too loosely. 
6. STOP. Do not got cut the holes for the M5 screws yet. you will do this after you build the horizontal bar that is shown below.
7. Repeat for the other side. It should be very snug when you try to hammer on the second plate and slightly mar the aluminum, but as long as you can get it on without ruining the plates too much, it's OK.                                                                                                                                          
Here are the horizontal bar and two smaller vertical bar dimensions. Cut the 80/20 stock to length.

Attach the 90 degree end feed fasteners (four per side) to the 80/20 framing. Then drill holes in the smaller 20mm end-feed fasteners for the flat head M5 screws. Drill and tap two holes per 20mm end feed fastener as shown below. Then find a way to put everything in place before tapping the end feed brackets for the M5 screws. I suggest duct tape. Make sure the horizontal bar is touching the four legs of the bed. Finally, while it is in place, use a fine tip sharpie and mark inside each of the tapped M5 holes on the end feed fastener, so that you put a black dot on the surface of the aluminum plate. Then, take the aluminum plates back off and drill holes where you marked with the sharpie. After you drill the holes, use a fillet bit to countersink them for the flat head screws. Then, install them on the frame and hook on both sides.

## Construction of the vertical A-frame

Here is a diagram depicting the A frame mount, which use four locking pivot joints and 30mm end feed fasteners to secure the frame to the bed.

Here are the 80/20 cut to size measurements. After you cut them to size, attach the locking pivot joints. Then attach the end feed fasteners to the A frame, and drill holes through the end feed fasteners and through the headboard of the bed to fit the large 1/4-20 screws. When you put the screws through and tighten a nut on the inside of the bed, I highly  suggest putting a piece of foam on the inside of the bed to cover up the nuts. This is where a person's head is in bed, so pad anything sharp and metal for safety.

You will have to use CAD to create and 3D print a holster for your camera (e.g. Kinect or Intel Realsense). I no longer have the CAD file for the one below, and it's not a great design anyway, so you'll have to create one. My frame is designed so the camera is 1.6m from the surface of the bed, and the camera attachment is very hacked together (but sturdy). However, the SLP dataset camera is 2.1m from the surface of the bed, so you will have to wrangle the images around and if you build the frame the way I did. The networks NEED images that are 2.1m from the bed surface, which can be done in your code. Alternatively you could cut the 80/20 aluminum longer so the camera hangs 2.1m from the surface of the bed, but then it would not fit with typical 8-9 foot ceilings. If you create a CAD file for this that is 3D printable, I would appreciate it if you would send it to me so I can add it to this repo and then credit you for it.
